              We rise up to the challenge, embrace change, and are energized by working on difficult problems worth
              solving. We believe in the process as much as the outcome.

              We are best known for our innovative Agile Classroom approach and our set of open-source adaptable
              tools for implementing it.

              We also develop prototypes of tools for reporting, data management, research, and development, often in
              connection with Northern Illinois University courses.

                Our most successful students are driven and motivated. They possess the curiosity and determination to drive
                and sustain a project from start to finish. They are comfortable with ambiguity and embrace change.
