I"Z<p>Federico’s proposal on an <em>Agile InspirEd Classroom</em> was selected as recipient of the 2019 Dean’s Instructional Innovation Summer Fellows Program.</p>

<p>Federico Bassetti submitted a proposal for the 2019 Dean’s Instructional Innovation Summer Fellows Program.  The response to &gt;the call for proposals exceeded our expectations and is a sign of the vibrancy of the college as well as our commitment to &gt;building a culture of innovation.  While we are excited to have received many more proposals than anticipated, this also made &gt;it very difficult for us to pick a couple of them to pilot this year.</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>Federico’s proposal was selected.  He will be notified by letter and e-mail later this week.</p>

  <p>Amy Buhrow</p>

  <p>Senior Director, Strategy, Student Success &amp; Accreditation</p>
