<h3 id="mission">Mission:</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to both assist the HMB in making their systems more efficient as they grow in size, as well as helping students of the OM&amp;IS department develop technical skills necessary to get ahead in their careers through real world experiences.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-behind-the-project">The Story Behind the Project:</h3>
<p>This capstone project initiated a partnership between the Department of Operations Management and Information Systems (OM&amp;IS) in the College of Business and the Huskie Marching Band (HMB) where OM&amp;IS students develop and implement technology solutions for the HMB.  We work on decreasing the time spent on administrative processes in order to focus on music and marching by simplifying and centralizing existing processes.</p>
