            <h2>Casey Walters</h2>
          <p>My name is Casey Walters, I am a graduate student studying Management Information Systems at Northern Illinois University. In May, I graduated undergrad with majors in Marketing and Operations Management & Information Systems, then immediately launched into my masters. As an InspirEd lab intern, I have had the opportunity to act as the product owner of the OM&IS Gazette, and work with the rest of the InspirEd lab team on various other projects. In the future, I hope to become a Product Owner at a company that uses an Agile methodology to work on IT projects and products.

            <h2>Chris</h2>
          <p>I have recently completed my PhD at the University of Cool Guys, studying the growth responses of tundra plants to climate change. I love to share my passion for nature and science, be it through outreach, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sandra.angers.b/" target="_blank">photography</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SandyAngersB" target="_blank">social media</a>, or teaching. I’ve been a tutor for the Coding Club for over two years, and I love that I get to learn new things every week by helping other participants solve their coding challenges! I am now working on developing our brand new online course set to launch in 2020 (stay tuned…). </p>

            <h2>Steve</h2>
          <p>I am a first year PhD student from the University of Edinburgh where I research how the canopy structure of savanna ecosystems is changing due to climate change. I have used R on a range of projects, from analysing employee satisfaction data for a private equity firm to mining linguistic transcripts for speech patterns. Through my own work, I have gained experience in using R for statistical modelling, mapping, data manipulation and R-markdown to make reproducible scripts. I have experience designing sustainable projects through my work in nature conservation and as the student representative for the Edinburgh University School of GeoSciences. I’m very interested in the role of open-source and collaborative technology in academia. I am part of the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Programme.</a></p>

            <h2>Kat Keogan</h2>
          <p>I am an ecologist interested in the effects of environmental change on marine ecosystems. For my PhD I am studying breeding phenology in seabirds, and the way in which they respond to changing conditions. I am researching the patterns, drivers and mechanisms of breeding phenology in a range of seabird species with diverse life history traits. I’m particularly interested in phenological trends on a global scale, and looking for patterns across phylogenetic groups or regions that might help us predict how species respond to environmental change. You can find more information <a href="http://phillimore.bio.ed.ac.uk/Kat%20Keogan">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Claudia</h2>
          <p>I'm in my 4th (and last!) year of my undergraduate degree. My interests lie in sustainable development and peaceful coexistence with nature i.e. 
              permaculture and my passion is definitely wildlife conservation! My dissertation will focus on biodiversity changes and ecosystem interactions 
              across altitudes, with access to data from cloud forests in Peru and alpine tundra in Canada. 
              For this, I will of course, be using R. I was introduced to R two years ago and since then have become fascinated 
              by with what computers can produce with a simple script of code. 
              It has been a love-hate relationship (but mostly love) and I want to show as many people as possible that coding is not as abstract or 
              inaccessible as it looks!</p>

            <h2>Sam</h2>
          <p>I'm an undergraduate in my final year studying at the University of Edinburgh, 
              with my honours project focusing on quantifying the above-ground carbon stored in Arctic ecosystems. 
              Over the years I've delved into many projects, from founding Elpis Solar, 
              a non-profit developing solar-powered infrastructure for refugee camps, 
              to establishing the Edinburgh Mindfulness Ambassador Award and Social Innovation Forum. 
              InspirEd Lab is a unique opportunity for students across the department to broaden their knowledge and 
              advance their field through working at the intersection of Experiential Learning and Informatics. I am excited to be part of this journey!</p>
