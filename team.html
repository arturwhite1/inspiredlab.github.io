            <h2>Casey</h2>
          <p>My name is Casey Walters, I am a graduate student studying Management Information Systems at Northern Illinois University. In May, I graduated undergrad with majors in Marketing and Operations Management & Information Systems, then immediately launched into my masters. As an InspirEd lab intern, I have had the opportunity to act as the product owner of the OM&IS Gazette, and work with the rest of the InspirEd lab team on various other projects. In the future, I hope to become a Product Owner at a company that uses an Agile methodology to work on IT projects and products.

            <h2>Chris</h2>
          <p>I have recently completed my Scrum Master intership at Discover and I am an OM&IS major at Northern Illinois University. 
            I joined InspirEd Lab in Summer 2019 studying the growth of Agile practice in Information Technology Education.
            I love to share my passion for teamwork development and Agile, be it through outreach, or teaching. 
            I’ve been a Scrum Master for the Discover code_orange for over 1 year, and I love that I get to learn new things 
            every week by helping other members working at their best to solve their coding challenges!
            I am now working on developing our brand new course set to launch in 2020 (stay tuned…). </p>

            <h2>Steve</h2>
          <p>I am a senion in OM&IS student from Rockford, Illinois where I research 
            how Jekyll and GitHub pages can be leveraged to develop an open source Agile classroom. 
            I have used R on a range of projects, from analysing employee satisfaction data for a 
            private equity firm to mining linguistic transcripts for speech patterns. 
            Through my own work, I have gained experience in using R for statistical modelling, mapping, 
            data manipulation and R-markdown to make reproducible scripts.  
            I’m very interested in the role of open-source and collaborative technology in academia.

            <h2>Zayra</h2>
          <p>I'm in my 4th (and last!) year of my undergraduate degree. 
            I was introduced to InspirEd Lab in the Fall 19, and since then I have been on the team prducing the OMIS Gazette.
              I am fascinated by what Jekyll and GitHub can produce with a simple set of Markdown and scripts. 
              It has been a love-hate relationship (but mostly love) and I want to show as many people as possible 
              that coding is not as abstract or inaccessible as it looks!</p>

          <p>I'm an undergraduate at NIU in OM&IS in my first year at InspirEd Lab.
            This is a unique opportunity for students across the department to broaden their knowledge and 
            advance their field through working at the intersection of Experiential Learning and Informatics. 
            I am excited to be part of this journey!</p>
