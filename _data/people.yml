- name: Steve Holder
  title: Developer - Intern
  testimonial: "I am a senior in OM&IS student from Rockford, Illinois where I research 
            how Jekyll and GitHub pages can be leveraged to develop an open source Agile classroom. 
            I have used R on a range of projects, from analysing employee satisfaction data for a 
            private equity firm to mining linguistic transcripts for speech patterns. 
            Through my own work, I have gained experience in using R for statistical modelling, mapping, 
            data manipulation and R-markdown to make reproducible scripts.  
            I’m very interested in the role of open-source and collaborative technology in academia."

  testimonial: "I have recently completed my Scrum Master intership at Discover and I am an OM&IS major at Northern Illinois University. 
            I joined InspirEd Lab in Summer 2019 studying the growth of Agile practice in Information Technology Education.
            I love to share my passion for teamwork development and Agile, be it through outreach, or teaching. 
            I’ve been a Scrum Master for the Discover code_orange for over 1 year, and I love that I get to learn new things 
            every week by helping other members working at their best to solve their coding challenges!
            I am now working on developing our brand new course set to launch in 2020 (stay tuned…)."

  title: Product Owner Intern - InspirEd Lab
  testimonial: "I am a graduate student studying Management 
  Information Systems at Northern Illinois University. In May, I graduated undergrad 
  with majors in Marketing and Operations Management & Information Systems, 
  then immediately launched into my masters. As an InspirEd lab intern, I
   have had the opportunity to act as the product owner of the OM&IS Gazette, 
   and work with the rest of the InspirEd lab team on various other projects. 
   In the future, I hope to become a Product Owner at a company that uses an Agile methodology to work on IT projects and products.
  Being a part of the Inspired Lab has challenged me to think in an agile mindset and embrace change."

  title: Producer OMIS Gazette
  testimonial: "I'm in my 4th (and last!) year of my undergraduate degree. 
            I was introduced to InspirEd Lab in the Fall 19, and since then I have been on the team prducing the OMIS Gazette.
              I am fascinated by what Jekyll and GitHub can produce with a simple set of Markdown and scripts. 
              It has been a love-hate relationship (but mostly love) and I want to show as many people as possible 
              that coding is not as abstract or inaccessible as it looks!  "
